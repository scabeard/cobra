we will be making an install script for debian

we will be making a minulmist install with only the tools needed for use in pen testing

our idea is to make a desktop that runs in a terminal

it has all the fancy gui similar to hacknet game on steam.

 show cpu,ram,network,ip, 

this is for doing vulnhub challanges

we need minulmist tools installed like nmap, nikto, python and coding tools, whatever tight compact tools we can get from parrot os for us

we will add tools later. 

our "desktop" will have folder/dir view along with terminals in tabs

we want a futuristic minimal install script that makes our debian install as lightweight as possible with the tools involved
